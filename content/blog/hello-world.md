        Hello World! I'm Mathis JOFFRE, the founder of 5GCoreNetSDK, a 21 years old French student @ESIR. This project is a student project. <br>
        Currently, the 5G Core Network (5GC) is a complex network that is based on a lot of different standards. The 5G Core Network is based on the 3GPP specifications that describes a set of REST API and data models usable to provide services in 5GC. <br>
        The 5GCoreNetSDK is an open source project that provides a set of APIs to access or provide services in 5G Core Network. The APIs are based on the 3GPP specifications and are implemented in Golang. At the moment, the APIs are implemented for the release 15 of the 3GPP specifications (3GPP TS 29.571 version 15.3.0 Release 15). <br>
